===================================================

JumpStart is compatible with the Long War Mod Manager for a slightly simpler install, or
you can still use PatcherGUI if you prefer.

LONG WAR MOD MANAGER INSTALLATION STEPS

1. Copy JumpStart.txt into your Mods folder and select & install it with your
   other mods.

2. Copy JumpStart.u into your XEW\XComGame\CookedPCConsole folder.  
   e.g. C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\Common\XCom-Enemy-Unknown\XEW\XComGame\CookedPCConsole
   
   **IMPORTANT: Don't forget the "XEW", otherwise you're installing it into 
     the EU folder and this won't work!**

3. Copy DefaultJumpStart.ini into the XEW\XComGame\Config folder. This should
   be a sibling folder to the CookedPCConsole folder.
   
   **IMPORTANT: This is just a placeholder sample and must be edited to make a
     useful campaign start. See step 4 below.**

PATCHERGUI INSTALLATION STEPS

1 Follow the instructions as for the Long War Mod Manager, except apply JumpStart.txt with
PatcherGUI instead of the LWMM. 

2. Edit XEW\XComGame\Config\DefaultMutatorLoader.ini and add the following line to the
   bottom of the file:

        arrStrategicMutators="JumpStart.JumpStart"
