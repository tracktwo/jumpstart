See INSTALL.txt for installation instructions.

JumpStart is a mod for Long War that allows you to customize the start of 
your campaign. Want to start in effectively the Summer of the first year with
laser weapons and carapace armor and wide middle-rank roster? Start basically
at the end game with a fully loaded squad and fully ranked volunteer, ready
to assault the temple ship? Start in March with accelerated alien research,
a bunch of noobs, but one set of precious plasma weapons that cannot be
replaced until researched the hard way? All possible.

The available options to set as part of the campaign are:

* Starting resources (e.g. money, alloys or scientists)
* Starting alien stats (alien resources, research, and X-Com threat level)
* Research projects completed
* Foundry projects completed
* OTS projects completed
* Facilities built
* Specific soldiers in the barracks, specifying rank, class, PSI rank, 
  and perks
* Bulk soldier addition to the barracks, specifying only rank
* Add arbitrary items to X-Com's storage
* Set starting panic level for countries
* Set starting satellite coverage over countries
* Set initial alien controlled countries

All of these options are controlled via the new DefaultJumpStart.ini file. 
A sample is provided in the installation archive, but this is NOT intended
to be used directly: it simply provides a sampling of the various things
that can be configured but is not any particular recommended starting
position. Editing the file to your taste or getting a publicly available
version of the file set up for a particular start is necessary for the
campaign start to make much sense!

TODO:

 * Eliminate the automatic first mission, start the game in the HQ
 * Make a better installer
 * Second wave option? Needs a better installer to handle other 3rd party SW 
   options without conflict.

Good luck, Commander!
