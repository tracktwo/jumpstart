===================================================

Until I have a fancy installer, you will need to install JumpStart the 
manual way. Follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have LW installed, this will not work with Vanilla. 
   Tested with 15f, but any B15 should work and possibly some earlier versions.
   
2. Apply the patch StartingNewGame.txt with PatcherGUI

3. Copy JumpStart.u into your XEW\XComGame\CookedPCConsole folder.  
   e.g. C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\Common\XCom-Enemy-Unknown\XEW\XComGame\CookedPCConsole
   
   **IMPORTANT: Don't forget the "XEW", otherwise you're installing it into 
     the EU folder and this won't work!**

4. Copy DefaultJumpStart.ini into the XEW\XComGame\Config folder. This should
   be a sibling folder to the CookedPCConsole folder.
   
   **IMPORTANT: This is just a placeholder sample and must be edited to make a
     useful campaign start. See step 4 below.**

5. If you're using an unmodified B15, you can copy the provided
   DefaultMutatorLoader.ini file into the XEW\XComGame\Config folder,
   overwriting the one that was already there. If you have made modifications
   to LW, you may already have a modified DefaultMutatorLoader.ini file. In this
   case, add this line to the existing file in your favorite text editor:
   
        arrStrategicMutators="JumpStart.JumpStart"

6. Edit the DefaultJumpStart.ini file you installed to the Config folder to set
   the parameters you want for your campaign.
   
7. Start a new game!
